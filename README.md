## The purpose of this project is as follows:
Simple implementation of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
## Here's some back story on why I needed to build this:
Often when I am browsing r/learnpython, I come across an interesting problem that I have not solved before. I do not always comment with my solution but I will usually keep the code (at least lately).
This project uses only python built-in functions and data types.


The expected frequency for running this code is As Needed.
